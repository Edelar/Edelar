## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Edelar/Edelar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a Senior Clinical Lecturer in Primary Care and Mental Health at the University of Liverpool and a General Practitioner (GP) in a local practice.
I believe that digital technologies can reduce the pressures on general practice and support everyone's efforts to be healthier and happier.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects:
      - translating retinal images into clinical information that can diagnose high blood pressure, define its severy and guide treatments
      - developing a system for an easier and better systematic medication review (SMR) as a team member of the DynAIRx project
      - developing a tool predicting the optimal skeletal muscle mass for the healthiest blood pressure.
    
- 🌱 While I have a PhD in my medical field (University of Birmingham, UK, 2012), I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science for Health and Social Care course at the University of Edinburgh in my free time.
